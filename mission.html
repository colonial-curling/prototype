        <p class="lead">
          Our primary goal is to create an environment where anyone interested
          in curling can be introduced to the sport and have fun while learning
          and improving the skills of the game.
        </p>

        <h1>Code of Conduct Policy</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          The Colonial Curling Association (the <b>"Club"</b>) is a not for
          profit club that aims to make the sport of curling available to all in
          a fun, friendly environment.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          The Code of Conduct has been developed to ensure that the Club is a
          safe, friendly and respectful place for members, visitors and ice
          center staff to engage in and support the sport of curling in the
          spirit of good will, fun, and friendly competition. This Code of
          Conduct specifically addresses unacceptable behavior and is an adjunct
          to the rules and by-laws of the Club.
        </p>
        <h3>Policy Modifications</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Recognizing that the Code will not cover every possible circumstance,
          the Code is broadly stated and thus, the Club, via the Board of
          Directors, may modify the Code as necessary at any time.
        </p>
        <h3>Administering the Code</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          The Club’s Board of Directors have responsibility for administering

            facility.
          </li>
          <li>

        <h1>Fee Reimbursement Policy</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          If a member of Colonial Curling (the <b>"Club"</b>) is unable to
          continue to curl after having signed up and paid for a session, then,
          upon written request, the Club will provide a credit (but not a
          refund) to that member for an amount equal to the pro-rated amount of
          the remaining balance of the session. That credit will be applicable
          for a future session. Such credits shall expire if not used within one
          year of the credited session. Acceptable reasons for such
          discontinuation and credit shall be at the discretion of the Board,
          but shall include an injury preventing curling, a death of a close
          family member or any other reason deemed appropriate by the Board.
